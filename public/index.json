This public history seminar explores the business of history through conversations with people whose business is history. We’ll explore various sectors where ‘history’ is a business plan, a source of content, or a way of life. Guests in the seminar come from the museum sector, professional research firms, tourism, and development. You will draw from these examples, these conversations, these opportunities, to develop your own plan.\nWhen that person smirks and asks you ‘what are you gonna do with a history degree, anyway’… show ’em this.\nA 0.5 credit course @ Carleton University in the Winter 2026 semester, with Professor Shawn M.

What is the \u0026lsquo;market\u0026rsquo; for it? What are the existing businesses in this area? Who are you anyway, and why are you here?\nAnswer the following questions, and organize into a visually pleasing way, in no more than three pages.\nPersonal inventory:\nWhy are you here? What is your goal for this class? What kind of experience(s) do you have that are relevant? How do you work with others? Do you delegate, or do you collaborate? Or are you entirely DIY? How do you deal with barriers? Environment scan:\nDo you have a general idea for what you want to create already? Describe it as best as you can. Who is the audience? Who is already in this space (ie, who is the competition)? See if you can find some numbers here in terms of dollars spent on x per year, or number of visitors in a given time frame, etc. Do you spot any patterns or trends (e.g, in demand for your idea over time)? How might these patterns have an impact on existing operators? Consider your idea in terms of its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (re threats, eg: generative AI and how might that factor in to things?) NB This isn\u0026rsquo;t a business plan or model; it\u0026rsquo;s a back-of-the-envelope blue-sky dreaming-big-dreams moment. The goal of this is to get you thinking about the practicalities and possibilities as we move into the second part of the class and hear from people out there in the history \u0026lsquo;industry\u0026rsquo;.\nLead Discussant / Backgrounder #Due before class before the relevant day.\nConduct background research on our guest\u0026rsquo;s particular industry or business so that you are prepared to lead the discussion and ask good questions. Prepare in advance twenty questions; use the ten questions from the Environmental Scan above as a way to get started, suitably modified given our guest\u0026rsquo;s background, industry, etc. Good questions are designed with a purpose in mind. Your goal is to understand this person\u0026rsquo;s work. You should be familiar with their company or field.\nThese questions along with a \u0026lsquo;backgrounder\u0026rsquo; document (5 - 10 pgs MAX) will be submitted to me electronically before the particular day and will be shared with the class.\nOn the day, I will introduce the guest, and after the initial chat, you will take on the role of asking the first questions (drawn from your list and background knowledge), and moderating the discussion.\nBusiness Model #Due April 3rd (one page synopsis due Apr 2 for use in class).\nIn part three, you\u0026rsquo;ll revisit your environment scan, your backgrounder (or someone else\u0026rsquo;s), in the light of what we\u0026rsquo;ve learned and our conversations with our guests, and you will prepare a business model document. Tell me (inter alia, as will become evident in the class):\nthe story: how did you conceive this idea; what makes it stand out; what will it be in the future? the experience: what has to happen in order for someone to want to use your brand/service/thing? What\u0026rsquo;s the unifying experience for your audience? Where will people encounter your thing? Are you producing a product or providing a service? Are you selling your own product/service or providing someone else\u0026rsquo;s? Do you own your own IP or are you licensing from someone else? Are you an owner/operator? A partnership? A co-op? A non-profit? How will you generate revenue? Who actually will pay you? Where does the initial funding come from? What makes this model sustainable? What makes this model historical? \u0026hellip;and whatever else is necessary.\nYou are trying to sell me on your idea. No more than ten pages. In addition, prepare a visually pleasing one-pager that captures everything. You will have ten minutes to share the one-pager with the class.\n","date":null,"permalink":"//localhost:1313/4916c-w26/docs/assessment/","section":"Syllabus","summary":"","title":"Assessment"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"//localhost:1313/4916c-w26/tags/biographies/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Biographies"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"//localhost:1313/4916c-w26/tags/docs/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Docs"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"//localhost:1313/4916c-w26/tags/grading/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Grading"},{"content":"Guests #These folks are engaged in \u0026lsquo;historical\u0026rsquo; ways of thinking to reach their customers, or are using historical \u0026lsquo;content\u0026rsquo; as the thing or service they\u0026rsquo;re selling/marketing.

The end of your studies is looming. What\u0026rsquo;s next? That\u0026rsquo;s what this seminar proposes to address. The course is broken into three broad modules. In the first, we\u0026rsquo;ll look at the \u0026lsquo;market\u0026rsquo; for history, whether that means \u0026lsquo;history\u0026rsquo; as a thing that people buy, or whether that means those skills and analytical rigour that your historical training have provided you: where might those things be in demand? In the second, we\u0026rsquo;ll talk with professionals across a wide variety of industries or activity areas. What is \u0026lsquo;historical\u0026rsquo; about what these folks are doing? How does their historical background inform what they do? As I write this in the fall of 2025, my suspicion is that we\u0026rsquo;ll see a lot of different kinds of storytelling, for a variety of purposes, to a variety of audiences, is key. In the third module, we\u0026rsquo;ll get down to it and use what we\u0026rsquo;ve learned to create a plan for each of you going forward. Maybe that\u0026rsquo;ll be a business plan. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;ll be a strategy for how you market yourself. I don\u0026rsquo;t know: that\u0026rsquo;s what we\u0026rsquo;re going to find out.\nBefore I was a prof, I hustled for work. In the 8 years between finishing grad school and starting at Carleton, I had two (2) academic job interviews: one in 2004, the other in 2010 (for Carleton). I hustled: I taught high school as a long-term substitute teacher; I pitched for research contracts with the NCC; I was part of two different business start-ups (one failed; the other continues); I set out my shingle as an independent researcher and wrote reports on the regulations surrounding nursing-home construction standards in Quebec. I applied for youth development grants and used them to write heritage inventories. I gave public talks about Roman archaeology and passed around the hat afterwards. All that to say I wish I had had an opportunity before all of that to think things through about what I really needed to do to set myself up for success.\nThis class therefore is an opportunity for us together to think through what you all might need to know, now.\nAims #The aim is to give you the time and space to explore the business of history, to imagine possible futures grounded in your historical training and interests. This, too, is public history. My goal is for you to leave this class with some kind of plan or model so you can hit the ground running.\nLearning Outcomes #By the end of this class you should be able to\nevaluate entrepreneurial opportunities that fit with your own priorities analyze existing business models for alignment with practices and principles of public history define and develop your own business plan / personal strategy Texts #All readings will be via the resources in our library, or open access. link here.\nSchedule #Thursday afternoons, 3 hrs, Winter Term. 2.35 - 5.25 pm.\nThe first part of the class (January 8, 15, and 22nd) is our startup phase where we\u0026rsquo;ll try to understand what the market for \u0026lsquo;history\u0026rsquo; is.\nThe second part of the class (January 29 - March 12) will feature weekly guests who we will talk with about their work. You will each be responsible as a designated \u0026lsquo;host\u0026rsquo; for a given week, having prepared questions and being willing to guide the conversation. Afterwards, you\u0026rsquo;ll pull together some thoughts on the things we\u0026rsquo;ve learned, the insights we\u0026rsquo;ve gleaned, which will be posted to this website.\nNote that reading week occurs the week of Feb 16 - 20.\nThe final part of the class (March 19, 26, and April 2) will be when you pull your plan together. This might be done individually, or as part of some larger group. On April 2nd you will present your plan to the class as a whole; we\u0026rsquo;ll hold a secret ballot to decide which one we think is most likely to succeed.\nSee more details here.\nGuest Bios #We are fortunate to have a number of guests willing to share their experiences and insights with us.
