# Why Me
### 'What are you going to do with that degree, anyway?'

- my folks never asked me that
- the rough road to carleton
- academic busking. Work history.

## Aims
	The aim is to give you the time and space to explore the business of history, to imagine possible futures grounded in your historical training and interests. This, too, is public history. 
	My goal is for you to leave this class with some kind of plan or model so you can hit the ground running.

My goal: to give you space to think about what you could be doing, to reflect on what you've learned and seen at Carleton and to plan for the future. To give you a framework for thinking through possibilities that come your way. To enable you to make your own luck.

## Who are you and what do you want out of this class?

Your goals?

TPS? Qs for them to answer
There are about 15 students in the class.

## What is the business of history, anyway?

- things they've seen? How to categorize; point of categorization is to identify commonalities, strengths, weaknesses, etc

# Where is the demand for 'history'?

Canadians and Their Pasts & other similar surveys

Chpt 1, 2, 6 of 'Canadians' and their pasts.

-result of ten years of surveys and focus groups, roughly 2006-2013, to explore the historical consciousness of Canadians. Led principally by Peter Seixas, history educator 
- some 3,419 Canadians, rather more than half of those contacted, agreed to participate: 400 each from five regions (the Atlantic provinces, Quebec, Ontario, the Prairies, and British Columbia), 1,000 from the five largest cities, and 100 each from three special groups: Acadians in New Brunswick, immigrants in the Peel region northwest of Toronto, and Aboriginal people living near Saskatoon. Responses were weighted to compensate for the over- and under-representation of various parts of the country. (https://muse-jhu-edu.proxy.library.carleton.ca/pub/50/article/596385)


What does it miss? 'Internet' is just viewed as a database... I was asked to join up shortly after starting at Carleton - Peter Seixas laughed at my ideas, because they weren't 'scientific' re methods re internet.

Similar project in Europe asked 'what does history mean to you?" "What presentations of history do you trust?" "What presentations of history do you enjoy?" > these are all 'history as product', never history-as-process, history as method for making sense of the world. Current world doesn't seem to value 'truth'; indeed, in the fascist worldview, gleefully embracing falsehoods is a way of signalling strength because the rules do not apply to you (thus, the way to undermine this is to demonstrate how that makes the person 'weak'). <- hmm, how to work this in.

What kinds of history are required for the present moment?

Rosenzweig and Thelen - mid/late 90s - found american deeply engaged in activities related to the past; over 80% of respondents watched materials, over 50% read a book, visited a site; over 30% involved in genealogical research... income only became a factor for activities requiring the purchase of equipment (cameras) but surely that's not an issue now. Even in the 90s, evangelical Americans tested highest in all of these things, which is suggestive. Big ticket 'official' historical events didn't matter too much in responses. Family, local always matters more. Women engaged more than men. Rosenzweig saw in all of this a call for historians to listen more and respect more of the ways Americans engaged with the past; he saw unsettling divisions. Thelen saw more common ground, arguing for more 'participatory historical culture'. In Australia, survey found family, physical objects were more important than physical places, for connecting to the past; storytelling, books, photos, and performance important. Museums and heritage sites across all national surveys always ranked super high. Internet not mentioned at all, given the time, and even today the pushing of digital history by academics into little dh ghettos is maddening. And AI? Oh shit don't get me started.

One reviewer of the project said, "But how does one actually bridge the gap between history and heritage, the professionals and the public? Should all public or active historians start with the personal or the familial to get at larger or national stories or is this a limited approach?  How can, or should, the public’s use of a “mythistory,” be counteracted?" (https://lh.journals.yorku.ca/index.php/lh/article/view/35831/32549)

My suggestion to you is that maybe that's the point of this class - Your thoughts?

## History as product versus way of looking at the world

How has your historical training so far made you look at the world? What are your 'skills'?
---

## [Assessment](https://hist4916c.netlify.app/docs/assessment/)
	1. Environmental Scan (30%)
	2. Backgrounder / Lead Discussant (30%)
	3. Business Model (30%)
	4. Above and Beyond (10%) (leadership in the seminar, quality of the work, sophistication of questions for our guests, etc.)

Do all the things in good faith, in the spirit in which they are offered, and you'll get the A range.

Do Lead Discussant / Backgrounder + the ES or BM: you'll get in the B range.

*ie I am letting you jettison 1/3 of the work recognizing that the world is awful* BUT NOBODY GETS TO SKIMP ON THE DISCUSSANT/BACKGROUNDER

    Environmental Scan: 30%
    Lead Discussant / Backgrounder: 30%
    Business model (includes in-class presentation): 30%
    Above and Beyond: 10% (leadership in the seminar, quality of the work, sophistication of questions for our guests, etc.)

## The inevitable AI bit

**IN CERTAIN LIMITED CONTEXTS CERTAIN GENERATIVE AI TOOLS MIGHT BE USEFUL** with permission and planning. Such permission will have to be obtained from me through personal consultation. You take responsibility for anything that a generative AI tool 'creates' (and note the inherent conservatism and lack of creativity inherent in such tools). Work created using generative AI that has not been pre-approved will be rejected and you will be required to redo it again. **Note that the use of such tools in certain contexts might undermine the value-proposition of a 'history' business in the first place.**

On the other hand, maybe an AI tool is central to your business model - maybe you develop a business scanning and OCR'ing handwritten documents for family historians. OK: which model will you use? What kind of infrastructure does that require? How will you avoid enshittification or getting locked out by the big AI companies when the bubble bursts? 

Maybe show them the 'sourcery' app, and Sheinfeldt's piece on handwriting being a solved business

# Ok, Who Will Do What, and When
	[Schedule](https://hist4916c.netlify.app/docs/schedule/)

- let's figure out which backgrounders people will do, get that assigned

# my favourite part: scheming

/assets/chris-linnett-jrWomn0ZUdc-unsplash.jpg

- Your thoughts on a history business you might want to build?
- blue sky thinking (see environmental scan part of course website)
- yes, you can partner up if you want; any partnerships in terms of assessment will have to include

# Next day
	Consider your initial scheme in the context of 'Canadians and their Pasts' and other similar surveys. Where do you fit? Who else is in that space? God help us all: maybe it's worth spending some time trawling through LinkedIn?
	Nuts and bolts stuff about running a business in Ontario/Quebec
	The funding landscape
	Maybe we'll try writing a funding application (or at least, a general summary for one).
