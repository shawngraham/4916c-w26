Your Historical Training as Entrepreneurial Edge.
{{< /lead >}}

This public history seminar explores the business of history through conversations with people whose business is history. We’ll explore various sectors where ‘history’ is a business plan, a source of content, or a way of life. Guests in the seminar come from the museum sector, professional research firms, tourism, and development. You will draw from these examples, these conversations, these opportunities, to develop your own plan. 

When that person smirks and asks you ‘what are you gonna do with a history degree, anyway’… show ’em this.
