## Guests

These folks are engaged in 'historical' ways of thinking to reach their customers, or are using historical 'content' as the thing or service they're selling/marketing. They've agreed to come and talk with us! Before any visit, my expectation is that you will have read or sought out literature pertinent to the relevant area.
